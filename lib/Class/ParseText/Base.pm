=head1 NAME

Class::ParseText::Base - Base class for modules using Parse::RecDescent parsers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Parser;
    use strict;
    
    use base qw(Class::ParseText::Base);
    
    # you need to provide an init method, to set the parser and start rule
    sub init {
        my $self = shift;
        
        # set the parser and start rule that should be used
        $self->{parser} = Parse::RecDescent->new($grammar);
        $self->{start_rule} = 'foo';
        $self->{ensure_newline} = 1;
        
        return $self;
    }
    
    package main;
    
    my $p = My::Parser->new;
    
    $p->parse_text($source_text);
    $p->parse(\$source_text);
    
    $p->parse_array(@source_lines);
    $p->parse(\@source_lines);
    
    $p->parse_file($filename);
    $p->parse($filename);

=head1 REQUIRES

This base class is in turn based on L<Class::Base>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All of the parse rules set C<< $self->{built} >> to false, to indicate that
a fresh source has been read, and (probably) needs to be analyzed.

=head2 new

    my $p = My::Parser->new;

Creates a new parser object. In general, calling C<new> explicitly is not
necessary, since all of the C<parse> methods will invoke the constructor
for you if they are called as a class method.

    # as a class method
    my $p = My::Parser->parse_file('some_source.txt');

=head2 parse_file

    $p->parse_file($filename);

Parses the contents of of the file C<$filename>. Returns the parser object.

=head2 parse_handle

    $p->parse_handle($fh);

Slurps the remainder of the file handle C<$fh> and parses the contents.
Returns the parser object.

=head2 parse_array

    $p->parse_array(@lines);

Joins C<@lines> with newlines and parses. Returns the parser object.

=head2 parse_text

    $p->parse_text($source);

Parse the literal C<$source>. Returns the parser object.

=head2 parse

    $p->parse($src);

Automagic method that tries to pick the correct C<parse_*> method to use.

    ref $src            method
    ========            ==================
    ARRAY               parse_array(@$src)
    SCALAR              parse_text($$src)
    undef               parse_file($src)

Passing other ref types in C<$src> (e.g. C<HASH>) will cause C<parse> to die.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

This class is definitely intended to be subclassed. The only method you should
need to override is the C<init> method, to set the parser object that will do the
actual work.

=head2 init

The following properties of the object should be set:

=over

=item C<parser>

The Parse::RecDescent derived parser object to use.

=item C<start_rule>

The name of the initial rule to start parsing with. The results of
the parse are stored in the object with this same name as their key.

=item C<ensure_newline>

Set to true to ensure that the text to be parsed ends in a newline.

=back

I<Be sure that you explicitly return the object!> This is a bug that
has bitten me a number of times.

=head1 TODO

C<parse_handle> method

Expand to use other sorts of parsing modules (e.g. Parse::Yapp)
