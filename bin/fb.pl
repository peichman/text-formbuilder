=head1 NAME

fb - Frontend script for Text::FormBuilder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ fb my_form.txt -o form.html
    
    $ fb my_form.txt -o my_form.html -D action=/cgi-bin/my-script.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parses a formspec file from the command line and creates an output
file. The sort of output file depends on the value given to the C<-o>
option. If it ends in F<.pm>, a standalone module is created. If it
ends in F<.pl> or F<.cgi>, a skeleton CGI script is created. Any other
value, will be taken as the name of an HTML file to write. Finally, if
not C<-o> option is given then the HTML will be written to STDOUT.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item C<< -D <parameter>=<value> >>

Define options that are passed to the CGI::FormBuilder object. For example,
to create a form on a static html page, and have it submitted to an external
CGI script, you would want to define the C<action> parameter:

    $ fb ... -D action=/cgi-bin/some_script.pl

=item C<< -o <output file> >>

Where to write output, and what form to write it in. See C<create_form> in 
L<Text::FormBuilder> for a more detailed explanation.

    # write a standalone module
    $ fb myform -o MyForm.pm
    
    # write a CGI script
    $ fb myform -o form.cgi
    $ fb myform -o form.pl
